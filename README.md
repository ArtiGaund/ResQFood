## About

ResQFood is a platform dedicated to the noble cause of reducing food wastage by facilitating the
redistribution of surplus food during late-night hours before restaurant closures. Our mission is to
ensure that excess inventory finds a purposeful destination rather than ending up in landfills,
contributing to a more sustainable and compassionate food ecosystem.

## How it Works

ResQFood streamlines the process of connecting restaurants with either Directly with the needy ones
or to a nearby establishments or charitable organizations, enabling them to efficiently redistribute
surplus food. Through our platform, restaurants can easily upload information about the available
surplus food, and establishments or organizations in need can browse and request donations. This
seamless connection ensures that surplus food gets to those who need it most, even during the late
hours when traditional donation channels may not be available.

## Features

- **Efficient Redistribution**: Our platform enables restaurants to quickly connect with nearby
  establishments or charitable organizations to redistribute surplus food before closing time.

  accurate and timely information for potential recipients.

  sustainable food ecosystem and reduces environmental impact.
- **Compassionate Giving**: Charitable organizations and establishments in need can easily browse
  and request donations, ensuring that surplus food reaches those who need it most.

## Architecture

ResQFood follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the
presentation layer from the business logic and data handling. This architecture pattern helps to
create a modular, scalable, and testable codebase.
