## About

ResQFood's vision is to build a world where delicious food doesn't end up in the trash.
By bringing together restaurants and individuals, we create a win-win scenario for everyone involved.

This platform is dedicated to the noble cause of reducing food wastage by facilitating the
redistribution of surplus food during late-night hours before restaurant closures. Our mission is to
ensure that excess inventory finds a purposeful destination rather than ending up in landfills,
contributing to a more sustainable and compassionate food ecosystem.

It is a mobile app designed to connect restaurants with individuals looking for a delicious and affordable 
meal while tackling food waste. It empowers restaurants to utilize leftover food instead of discarding it
and provides individuals with access to great deals on quality food.
